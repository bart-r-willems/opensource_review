Few things are as elementary as a text editor. Windows comes of course with *Notepad* but that is about as barebones as it gets. There are many excellent text editors available but most are heavily geared towards the #1 target audience: programmers.

Notepad++ is different. Of course, it can still be used -- and is used -- by programmers, but it is in the first place an upgrade over the regular Notepad -- hence the name. Some of the features that Notepad++ offers are:

* Change case (upper/lower, etc)
* Indent/unindent (with tab/shift tab)
* Advance find/replace
* Show whitespace
* Open multiple documents (accessible through tabs)
* Highlight text based on file type (html, markdown, etc)

There are many more, but despite the richness it offers, Notepad++ never feels intimidating, unlike some “better” alternatives like *Visual Studio Code*.
